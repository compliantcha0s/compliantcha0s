## Hi there 👋 👋 Welcome to the world of compliantcha0s

Hi, I’m Aaron—operating under the handle compliantcha0s.I’m a GRC analyst @ Kingfisher Data (KFD), where I help small and midsize organizations bring structure, insight, and resilience to their risk and compliance strategies.

🛡️ Risk | ⚖️ Compliance | 🔍 OSINT | 📁 Governance

🧠 What I’m About

I come from a background in financial services, operations, and business analysis, and I’ve shifted into the risk and data security space with a focus on:

- Vendor risk management
- Internal audit frameworks
- Policy and controls design
- Security awareness and compliance culture
- Building usable tools that bridge business + security

*Former Series 7, 63, and 66 holder with fiduciary certification—bringing a trust-first mindset to GRC and data security.*

💻 What I’m Working On

- A public-facing Risk Toolkit repo for small orgs: templates, risk matrices, audit checklists
- Internal tools and frameworks at Kingfisher to support data security compliance and operational trust
- Learning Git, Markdown, Python, SQL, and everything else that makes an analyst dangerous

🧹 Why “CompliantCha0s”?

Because real risk management isn’t just about ticking boxes—it’s about recognizing the tension between uncertainty and structure./Nothing says “controlled chaos” like **the Hulk wearing a suit and quoting regulations.**
